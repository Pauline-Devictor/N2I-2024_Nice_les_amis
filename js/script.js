			'For decades, these unscrupulous industrialists had ruthlessly exploited natural resources, emitting enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, plunging the planet into ecological chaos. Political leaders, complicit in this devastating enterprise, turned a blind eye to the warnings of scientists and environmental advocates, choosing to sacrifice the future in the name of present greed.',

Environmental rebels were rising, determined to overthrow the destructive reign of these villainous industrialists and political leaders.
